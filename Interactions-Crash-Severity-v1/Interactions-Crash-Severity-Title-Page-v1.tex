  \begin{abstract}
  Road accidents impose an important burden on health and the economy.
  Numerous efforts to understand the factors that affect road collisions
  have been undertaken. One stream of research focus on modelling the
  severity of crashes. Crash severity research is useful to clarify the
  way different factors can influence the outcome of the event. The
  objective of this paper is to assess different strategies to model the
  interactions between participants in a crash, in the context of crashes
  involving two parties. Towards this objective, a series of models are
  estimated using data from Canada's National Collision Database. Three
  levels of crash severity (no injury/injury/fatality) are analyzed using
  ordered logit models and covariates for the participants in the crash
  and the conditions of the crash. Modelling strategies include different
  ways of introducing the covariates (e.g., in a single-level or
  multi-level form), as well as by subsetting the dataset. The models are
  assessed using predicted shares and outcomes, and the results highlight
  the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity
  analysis. On the other hand, the study suggests that hierarchical (i.e.,
  multi-level) specifications and subsetting do not perform necessarily
  better than a relatively simple single-level model with opponent
  effects.
